Excited to share my recent Data Analyst project focused on dialysis of patients!

Dataset overview:
•Domain : Healthcare
•Project Name: Dialysis of Patients
•Dataset Name: Dialysis – I & Dialysis – II
•Dataset Type: CSV Data
•Dataset Size: Each CSV file has 7k+ records

Insights:

●Number of Patients across various summaries :
summaries related to different diseases treatment might involve categorizing patients based on the medical conditions for which they require dialysis. These summaries could provide insights into the prevalence of specific diseases within the patient population receiving dialysis and how these conditions impact treatment patterns and outcomes.

●Profit Vs Non-Profit Stats:
Comparing financial performance between different healthcare facilities.
●Chain Organizations w.r.t. Total Performance Score as No Score:
Evaluating the performance of chain organizations, particularly those without a score.
●Dialysis Stations Stats:
Checking how these places where patients get dialysis are doing, like how busy they are and how well they're working.
● Patients as of Category Text - As Expected:
Determine the expected number of category texts and evaluate their impact on the overall dataset.
●Average Payment Reduction Rate :
Calculate and track the average rate at which payments are reduced, providing insights into cost-saving measures.

Challenges encountered during project work:

●Data Quality Issues:
Dealing with incomplete, inaccurate, or inconsistent data due to errors in data collection or entry, which can affect the reliability and validity of analysis results.
●Missing Data Handling: 
Developing strategies to address missing data points, whether they are due to patient non-response, data entry errors, or other reasons, to minimize bias and ensure robust analysis outcomes.
●Data Transformation Complexity:
Transforming raw data into usable formats for analysis, including cleaning, filtering, aggregating, and formatting data according to analytical requirements, which can be time-consuming and error-prone.
